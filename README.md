# File Naming Format

- Each exercise must be saved using proper naming and formatting:
  - `ex01`, `ex02`, `ex03`, and so on.
- Example:
  - First exercise → `ex01.py`
  - Second exercise → `ex02.py`
  - Third exercise → `ex03.py'

# Running your first program

- You will have to open the terminal and type:
   'python [your filename]'

- Example:
  - 'python ex01.py'
